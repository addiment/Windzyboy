# I make stuff.

We do a lot of programming.
- I wrote a [crappy chat platform](https://voicebox.windzyboy.com) using Node.JS (and am unwilling to pay for server fees)
- I made a bunch of other [crappy websites, including my own](https://windzyboy.com/).
- Sometimes I make [crappy games](https://windzyboy.itch.io) in Unreal Engine, and I know some [SDL2](https://libsdl.org/).

## I'm somewhat of an important person...
- I contributed code to Unreal Engine 5 ([...by changing 1 line](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/commit/424c212bd6706246dbb3e8f4114a9100ccf4c8fc))
- I contributed to the Valve Developer Wiki ([...by rewriting a pointless 1-paragraph article](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/w/index.php?title=Refresh_SDK_Content&oldid=251411))
- I wrote a Wikipedia article ([...that got declined, for an obscure Flash game nobody cares about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Hand_&_Stars))
